                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>Hi, I'm Roy! I'm a 19-year-old student diving deep into the world of web development. What excites me most about this field is how it 
                       combines creativity with problem-solving - I love building things that people can actually use and enjoy.</p>
                    <p>Currently, I'm learning the ins and outs of full-stack development at Red River College Polytech. Every day brings new challenges as
                       I work to master both front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and back-end systems that make everything work behind the scenes.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not coding, you'll often find me strumming my guitar (I've been playing for 3 years), competing on the soccer field, or teaming up with
                       friends for video game sessions. These hobbies keep me balanced and creative - whether it's the rhythm of music, the teamwork in sports, or the problem-solving
                       in games, they all surprisingly connect back to my passion for development in different ways.</p>
                    <p>This portfolio represents my journey as I grow from a beginner to a professional developer. Each project shows my progress and my passion for this constantly evolving field.</p>

                    <h4>Current Studies</h4>
                    <p>Currently completing WEBD-1008 Web Development course, focusing on HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript fundamentals.</p>

                <article>
                    <h4>My First Web Development Project</h4>
                    <p>This portfolio website represents my very first complete web development project. Through building it, I'm learning:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTML5 structure and semantics</li>
                        <li>CSS styling and responsive design</li>
                        <li>Basic JavaScript functionality</li>
                        <li>Website deployment process</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>While simple, this project marks the beginning of my journey as a developer and demonstrates my ability to learn and apply new technical skills.</p>
